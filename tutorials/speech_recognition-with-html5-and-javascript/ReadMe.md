# Speech Recognition 

These basics are used to get to know each other and create simple  „Voice Interface projects“ using HTML5 and JavaScript. This can be expanded with advanced knowledge and developed his own voice interface.

At the moment, only Google Chrome has the „Voice Interface Projects“ running.

## Further research or possible alternatives to Google Translate API

**My Memory**

The following description is from the website https://translatedlabs.com/
mymemory“:

MyMemory is the world's largest translation memory. It was created to collect translation 
memories of the European Union and the United Nations and to vote on the best domain-specific 
multilingual websites.

You can search for translations in MyMemory via a Web user interface, an API and several CAT 
Tool plugins and search integrations. You can download translation memories in TMX format and 
use them with your CAT tool of your choice. You can also help make MyMemory even better with 
your reminders or edit entries. If no human translation is found for your sentences, MyMemory 
will help you with state-of-the-art machine translation technology.

Currently, MyMemory contains 4,401,923,570 human-translated Segments.

**appery.io**

Is a cloud-based development environment that enables the creation of mobile and responsive apps 
(similar to "dialogflow"). This tool can also be used to integrate a translation function, but after
our research, only a written translation is possible, no simultaneous translation.

**MIT App Inventor**

Is a developed development environment to program applications for the operating system "Android". 
The tool provides a graphical interface for the user, which makes it possible to "drag and drop" 
graphical blocks (graphic programming language) to the respective application the smartphone, add.

Pro:
- Internet actually requires WiFi only for Android
- Complex things go awkward or not at all
- no own classes (no attributes and methods of classes, no constructors)
- little object creation at runtime (create all before and on/hide)

Con:
- Internet actually WLAN also needed
- only for Android
- Complex things go awkward or not at all
- no own classes (no attributes and methods of classes, no constructors)
- little object creation at runtime (all previously create and on/hide)

**Yandex**

Is a Russian-Dutch company providing IT services that also offers cloud services among other things. 
Yandex offers a wide range of services and products, including Internet advertising services, its own
Browser (Yandex.Browser), an online translator, a map service (Yandex.Maps) email inboxes, cloud 
services or an AppStore for the operating system Android.

Yandex Translate API:

provides access to the Yandex online translation service. It supports more than 90 languages and can 
translate single words or complete texts. The API allows Yandex.Translate to be embedded in a mobile app 
or web service for end users. Also the translation of large amounts of text (for example, technical 
documentation) is possible.

**Vue.js**

Is a client-based JavaScript web framework that can be used to build both small and large client applications. It offers versatile functions and continuous development, but also stable APIs. According to the developers, Vue.js is easier to learn than Angular JS (https://angularjs.org/) because the API is simpler. All you need is knowledge in JavaScript and HTML. An illustrative documentation for learning Vue.js is available at https://vuejs.org/
